Description: Performs Binary Differential analysis (BDA) on single cell RNA
  sequencing data. Instead of relying on changes in the expression value of genes
  across cell populations, which can be sparse and are subject to many
  pre-processing steps, BDA uses the binary gene expression patterns across
  biological distinct cell populations, i.e. are there more or less zeros for a
  gene in condition A compared to condition B.
